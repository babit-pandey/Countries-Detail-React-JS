- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I have learnt so many things after doing this project. This took time but helped me a lot. I learned to use React hooks properly. I learned to implement Pagination, Dark Mode, Grid Layouts, etc. properly. Previously I just had knowledge about it but not proper practice as I did not find suitable project for me but now I learnt so many things doing this project. Including adding filters in website, search feature, routes using react-router, using context api of react js and much more.

### Continued development

If I want to continue in this project in future then I would like to implement so many things in this website. First of all I would like to include much more informations in country details page. I will include more informations below flag section. There I want to see more information of countries. I would also like to make back button of Country details page truly back. Suppose you search for country as "China" then China appears, then if you click China and click that button then it redirects you to home page but I want to make it such that it goes to search result page where user was previously. Though I can implement all these things right now but I am unable to do right now. I am hoping to continue it in future.
